## üå± Context
**ReRe (Regenerative Resources)** is a pioneering protocol driving the cultural transition of Web3 toward regeneration. Since 2022, it has hosted almost daily online meetings and weekly dynamics, where participants explore ReFi concepts, develop proof-of-concepts, and connect their challenges and abundances to the creation of collective value. In the long term, ReRe aims to co-create a new cyber layer called **Web3 Regen**. Through these interactions, ReRe has become a space for ongoing collective intelligence and the articulation of regenerative initiatives/projects in Brazil.

ü§ù **How it works**: These online meetings are dedicated to co-creation and critical mapping of initiatives and development of value propositions through debates, theoretical and practical exchanges on Web3, Open Source, and ReFi. By relating the challenges and abundances of each person, project, or community, participants learn to apply Web3 concepts in their own contexts. This process has enabled the effective dissemination of regenerative and decentralized foundations, connecting experiences and good practices throughout the Brazilian ecosystem. Within this flow, ReRe also created the first **Shared Resource Commons Pool (PCdRC)**, a P2P dynamic for mutual access to resources ‚Äî financial, technological, material, social, etc. ‚Äî guided by equity principles. This mechanism enables resource matching beyond finances to pair participants and make joint projects viable.

## üîÅ Connections
**AgroforestDAO**: As an active project within the ReRe ecosystem, AgroforestDAO had a latent need for digital integration to launch a Web3 ReFi solution for agroecology. In this context, ReRe provided the collaborative environment for various projects to join forces, resulting in the launch of the **Feij√£o Amigo** initiative in March 2023, during the first edition of the **Feijoada SAFA** (a side event at Ethereum Rio 23). NFTs representing land plots were created to fund Brazil‚Äôs first decentralized agroforestry initiative.
**Feij√£o Amigo**: In 2023, the first edition of **ReRe/Feijoada SAFA** brought together key ReFi projects in Brazil ‚Äî **AgroforestDAO, Ekonavi, Borderless Money, Knot Studios/Tree Tales, FitoEst√¢ncia, Doces Lembran√ßas, Rio Crypto Hub**, and **Papel Semente**. Through a Shared Resource Commons Pool (PCdRC), the event mobilized 150 participants and launched the **Feij√£o Amigo NFT**, which initiated Brazil's first decentralized Web3 ReFi agroforestry in partnership with AgroforestDAO.
**Greenpill Brasil**: In another ReRe meeting in mid-2023, one of the ecosystem co-founders shared the opportunity to establish a Brazilian chapter of the **Greenpill Network**. The idea resonated with several co-creators, who organized a working group and brought the concept to life. From this collaboration, **Greenpill Brasil** was born.

## ‚ú® Vision
Projects like **AgroforestDAO** and **Greenpill Brasil**, among many others, have been nurtured through the ReRe ecosystem. These cases inspired the creation of **Glocal Regenerators**, an initiative that systematizes this process of fostering and catalyzing regenerative projects through collective intelligence and collaborative infrastructure. Acting as a ‚Äúredhat desacelerator,‚Äù Glocal Regenerators was initially created to connect directly with **Celo** due to its unique attributes and presence in Brazil, and in the medium term, to build relationships with the private sector, governments, and NGOs to generate real impact across diverse socio-environmental contexts.

## üåç Glocal Regenerators: A Living Model
Glocal Regenerators is the natural evolution of this process ‚Äî a living ecosystem that is open-source, replicable, and rooted in community wisdom. It invites others to grow their own regenerative pathways with Web3.

## üåü Our Impact
Glocal Regenerators already generates real impact through documented practices and catalyzes networks with replicable actions such as:
- Partnership with **REGOSH**, **Modular Eco Industry**, and **Solarpunk Brasil** to apply decentralized resource allocation mechanisms on-chain to Free and Open Source Technology (FOST) projects.
- Creation of trust-based listening networks.
- Development of **commons pools** for shared resources.
- Structuring of situated regenerative education with open methodologies that encourage critical thinking (e.g., critical onboarding).

## üé• @abundancerere 

The YouTube channel **@abundancerere** is an educational cultural extension of the ReRe ecosystem, from which Glocal Regenerators is already benefiting. With over 6,000 hours of recorded content, it documents workshops, daily meetings, and practical regenerative Web3 experiences. The channel acts as a bridge between global networks and Brazilian communities, democratizing access to Web3 with cultural sensitivity, critical reflection, and practical focus.

## üß≠ Project Justification
Web3, as an emerging decentralized technology, has the potential to redefine how people interact, create value, and coordinate resources. However, many enter this ecosystem with industrial-era paradigms ‚Äî binary thinking, predatory extraction, overproduction, and centralization.

### üîç The Problem
- **Old Paradigms in New Tools**: Web3 used for immediate profit, speculation, high energy consumption, and social exclusion.
- **Lack of Critical Thinking**: Uncritical adoption of dominant narratives without assessing social and ecological impact.
- **Disconnection from Local Contexts**: Solutions often ignore the cultural, social, and ecological realities of the territories in which they are deployed.
- **Lack of Consideration for the Planetary Crisis**: Despite crossing 6 of the 9 planetary boundaries by 2023, few projects propose concrete local actions to support planetary health from their territories.
- **Lack of Climate Resilience**: Many initiatives fail to leverage the potential of open-source networks to develop systemic adaptation and mitigation solutions ‚Äî such as decentralized clean energy, local food production, plastic recycling, and regenerative biodesign.

## üå± The Opportunity
To cultivate new mindsets and coordinate local actions that:
- Stimulate critical thinking and collective intelligence.
- Promote decentralized and collaborative governance.
- Connect emerging technologies with ancestral knowledge and glocal ecosystems for local regenerative action.
- Link local problem-solving needs with the funding and tools of Web3 ReFi.

## üéØ About the Proposal
- **Culture of Reflection & Critique**: Expand critical onboarding of new people and projects through ReRe‚Äôs open daily sessions.
- **Commons Knowledge**: Publish the ReRe Root Wiki to share and co-create free knowledge across the community.
- **Open Innovation & Appropriate Technologies**: Foster the creation and ‚Äúprodusage‚Äù of FOST through DIWO (Do It With Others) workshops teaching people in urban, rural, and traditional communities to build context-appropriate autonomous solutions.
- **Open Education**: Produce accessible learning content ("knowledge pills") on Web3 ReFi, Gitcoin, Celo, Planetary Health, and Regenerative Systems Design.
- **Regenerative Systems**: Promote development and deployment of integrated FOST-based solutions like biodigesters, micro wind turbines, plastic recycling, using NFTs with impact, impact DAOs, regeneration-backed tokens, and scientific impact metrics.
- **Local & Global Integration**: Strengthen connections between territories and global networks such as Celo, Greenpill Network, Regen Coordination, and ReFi DAO.

## üåü We Can Do So Much
- **Awareness & Engagement**: We create accessible narratives, immersive learning spaces, and cultural translations to welcome diverse communities into ReFi. We are scaling the proven methodology from ReRe to reach more people and projects.
- **Adoption & Development**: We can prototype tools like cREAL for agroforestry and local economies, develop smart contracts on Celo, and support decentralized governance.
- **On-Chain Economic Activity**: Through NFTs, DAOs, and blockchain funding, we keep value circulating within regenerative ecosystems.
- **Regeneration**:
